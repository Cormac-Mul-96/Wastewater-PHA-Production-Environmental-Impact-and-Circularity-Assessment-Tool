# Wastewater-PHA-Production-Environmental-Impact-and-Circularity-Assessment-Tool
This is an excel based tool that can be used to qunatify the amount of PHA and biogas that can be produced from the sludge produced in a wastewater treatment plant based on user inputs.
The tool will also quantify the cost of production, environmental impact and circularity of the PHA and/or biogas production process.
This tool is intended to give an indication of the benefits of PHA production vs biogas to help decide on the most beneficial pathway for wastewater sludge treatment. 
PHA and biogas production are modelled using values taken from peer reviewed literature or textbooks. These values are likely to change over time, therfore they can be edited by the end user as needed.
